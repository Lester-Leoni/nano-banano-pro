"""Future SaaS foundation (no auth/billing implemented).

This package intentionally contains *skeleton* abstractions and safe defaults that
prepare the codebase for future:
  - API keys
  - subscriptions
  - usage-based limits

Nothing here should change the current UX or introduce user accounts today.
